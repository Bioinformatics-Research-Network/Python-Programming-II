**Assessment Premise**: 

**TLDR; Take the functions from [Python Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/Python-Programming-I) and turn them into a package called "bioutils"**

After you completed the tasks your supervisor gave you in [Python Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/Python-Programming-I), you get a call from HR. Apparently, your functions were so useful that you have been promoted from a Bioinformatics Assistant to Bioinformatics Associate üöÄ. Your first task will be to turn your `utils.py` script into a package, `bioutils`, for the whole bioinformatics team to use üéØ. The package should contain all the functions you wrote in `utils.py`, but properly formatted as a package and well-documented. This will enable your colleagues to easily install your package and use the functions contained within!

Users will use your package like so:

```Python
import bioutils as bu

cancer = "ATCGCATACGA"
normal = "ATCCCAGATGA"

bu.protein_variant(cancer, normal)
```


### Automated testing / checking

Prior to releasing the package, your new supervisor will make sure that everything works correctly and that it is well-formatted. She will deploy a bot to run automated checks on your package -- they should produce no errors or warnings.

<details>
<summary>Automated checks</summary>

The bot will initiate an `Python v3.10.4` session and install `bioutils` package by running:

```shell
pip install .
```

Then it will test the package by running:

```shell
pytest
```

Next, it will check the style of the package using `flake8` from the linux command line:

```shell
flake8 .
```

</details>

**Note**: You do not need to write any unit tests as these have already been created for you in the `tests/` folder. 

## Guidance

Most guidance for this assessment is identical to [Python Programming I](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/Python-Programming-I).
